colorblind-helper
=================

A collection of CSS tweaks to make commonly used websites a bit more friendly to colorblind users.

===

Currently supports okcupid.com and eBay (all countries).

If there's a particular page element on these (or other) sites that could be changed so it's easier for colorblind or color-deficient users to navigate, feel free to submit an issue or make the change yourself and submit a pull request.

Thanks to /u/darthvader666uk for his eBay changes.
